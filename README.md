Sleep Number Bed SleepIQ interface for SmartThings

This SmartApp retrieves state information from SleepIQ for a Sleep Number Bed.  The bed can be used as a sleep sensor and a presence sensor.  At this time it utilizes polling, which a configurable poll frequency in minutes.  An account with SleepIQ is required.

Use at your own risk.  It works for me.  Please don't abuse the APIs exposed by SleepIQ.
